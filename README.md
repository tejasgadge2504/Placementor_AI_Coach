## Agents
### Resume Parser

- **Purpose**: Extracts structured information from a user's uploaded resume.
- **Logic**:
  - Uses the Gemini model within the Agno framework to parse the resume and extract key details such as full name, email, phone, skills, projects, education, and work experience.
  - Constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to return the extracted information in a structured JSON format.
  - Processes the AI response to extract and return the relevant information in the specified format.
 
### Interview Planner

- **Purpose**: Generates a structured interview plan based on the user's resume, target company, role, and interview round.
- **Logic**:
  - Uses the Gemini model within the Agno framework to create a list of interview questions tailored to the user's selected parameters.
  - Constructs a detailed prompt that guides the AI to generate questions simulating a real interview, starting with introductory questions and gradually increasing in difficulty.
  - Outputs the interview plan in a structured JSON format, ensuring easy integration with other components.

### Question Fetcher

- **Purpose**: Retrieves specific questions from an interview plan based on the serial number.
- **Logic**:
  - Takes an interview plan and a serial number as inputs.
  - Converts the serial number to a string to match the format in the JSON data.
  - Iterates through the interview plan to find and return the question corresponding to the given serial number.
  - Returns an error if the question is not found, ensuring robustness in handling missing data.


### Feedback Agent

- **Purpose**: Evaluates user responses to interview questions and provides constructive feedback.
- **Logic**:
  - Utilizes the Gemini model within the Agno framework to analyze user answers based on structure, clarity, relevance, and impact.
  - Constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to evaluate answers on a scale of 1 to 10, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and decide if the user should repeat the question.
  - Processes the AI response to extract and return a structured JSON format containing the score, feedback, corrected answer, and repeat status.
